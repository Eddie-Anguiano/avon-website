            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              One of the Face Shop’s newest products is the Flat Velvet Lipstick. It is a uniquely
              shaped flat square tip lipstick which shapes, lines, contours and fills lips
              effortlessly. It is a velvety matte finish infused with calendula oil which soothes,
              argan oil which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and jojoba and olive
              oil to keep winter lips smooth and moisturized. The shape of the tip keeps lipstick
              from feathering and bleeding. It comes in ten highly pigmented delicious shades. Four
              of the ten available shades are red. Those reds are, Darjeeling Red, a deep dark warm
              red, Cassis Red is a sumptuous cool red, London Red is a bright true red and Scarlet
              Red is a true warm red. The other colors available range from Solar Beige to Be My
              Pink. I love the unique shape of these lipsticks because they offer flexibility for
              lining the lip and filling the color in.

            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              A lightweight, long lasting lip stain is another new product from the Face Shop that
              you will see in the Avon Brochure. This vivid lip stain comes in two finishes, matte
              and shine. The applicator is teardrop shaped which provides for a precise, full
              application. The Tatoo Matte version dries to a matte stain while the Serum Shine
              leaves a deep tint with a high gloss finish. These Ink Tints also come in four shades
              of red, twelve shades in total. If you plan on using matte lipsticks, you might want
              to lightly exfoliate your lips once or twice a week. Matte lipsticks go on best when
              your lips are smooth and kept moisturized . A chemical exfoliant is great for this.
              Alpha hydroxy acid is the best chemical exfoliant. Avon has two products with AHA’s.
              One is a very mild cream, AHA Refining Cream, and there is also a stronger exfoliant,
              Extra Strength Retexturizing Peel. To keep your lips moist, a product such as Anew
              Vitamin C Antioxidant Lip Treatment is a great product. This treatment which nourishes
              with vitamins C and E makes lips look and feel smooth and conditioned.

            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              Before you apply your foundation, prepare your skin with Avon’s Face Shop Primer. Why
              should you use a foundation primer? A primer increases the life of your foundation so
              that you need less touch ups throughout the day. The Ink Lasting Primer turns your
              skin into a smooth poreless canvas that keeps your makeup in place all day. Primers
              also prepare the skin by giving it a smooth base that corrects imperfections by
              minimizing and blurring them. This colorless gel primer minimizes pores, absorbs oil
              and provides a matte surface that increases the staying power of your foundation. This
              primer also lightly hydrates your skin with rose oil and prune extract.

            <h2 class="blog__subheader">Toneup Primer</h2>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              This primer not only lightly hydrates the skin and prepares it for foundation, it also
              uses color correction technology to minimize blotchiness and to correct undertones.
              These primers just melt into the skin and do not need much foundation to cover them.
              The Lavender Toneup Primer corrects sallow or yellow tones in the skin. This also
              helps if you wish to use cool colors for your lips, eyes and cheeks. Toneup Primer in
              Mint neutralizes red tones and blotches. This covers the redness from blemishes and a
              ruddy complexion. For pale skin, the Pink Toneup Primer adds brightness to the skin.
              The use of the Lumiere Toneup Primer with an iridescent pearl base adds radiance to
              the complexion.

            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              This versatile formula is a buildable formula. It can be used for medium to full
              coverage. The formula is long wearing but is not cakey. It feels weightless and airy.
              As this foundation evens out skin tone, it also leaves a velvety matte finish. The
              color selection is exceptional since it comes in eighteen shades in cool, warm and
              neutral hues. The categories are divided up into light, warm and deep. Each category
              is comprised of two cool shades, two warm shades and two neutral shades. When you are
              applying color to your face such as eyeshadow, lipstick and blush, it is important to
              keep your colors in the same categories as your foundation whether they be warm (w),
              cool (c) and neutral (n).

            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              This is the same formula and color selection as the Ink Lasting Foundation Slim Fit.
              However, this foundation comes in a unique compact. This technologically advanced
              compact is portable and delivers the perfect amount of foundation to its sponge with
              no mess or spillage. The compact has a mesh screen that controls the amount of
              foundation that is deposited onto the sponge. The sponge is made 3of an antibacterial
              material. Because the formula is the same as the Ink Lasting Foundation, it is also
              buildable. However, it does have the ability to be dispensed in smaller amounts for
              lighter coverage. With that being said, it is also an excellent item for a touchup if
              you have already applied your makeup with the Ink Lasting Foundation.
