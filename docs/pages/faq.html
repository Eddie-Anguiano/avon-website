          <h2 class="blog__subheader">What does it mean to become an Avon Representative?</h2>
          <p class="blog__paragraph">
            Part-time or full-time, anytime and anywhere, sell Avon’s beauty and personal care
            products to family, friends and associates face to face or online. Avon provides you
            with your own maintenance free website for easy online ordering. Your customers can shop
            your website 24/7 or your customers can shop face to face with you and the iconic Avon
            brochure. You can earn commissions of 40% with our Kick Start program. The cost to
            become an Avon Representative is $30.
          </p>

          <h2 class="blog__subheader">What products does Avon sell?</h2>
          <p class="blog__paragraph">
            Avon introduces the Face Shop! Along with Avon branded products such as Skin So Soft,
            Anew Skin Care and True Color Makeup, Avon is now selling naturally based products from
            the Face Shop. The company also carries jewelry, personal care products, products for
            men and children, clothing and home decor.
          </p>

          <h2 class="blog__subheader">How can I sell Avon Products?</h2>
          <p class="blog__paragraph">
            There are two ways to sell Avon. You can distribute the iconic Avon brochure to
            potential customers face to face, by mail or via an internet link through text or email.
            Your customers can contact you with their orders and you can then order the products
            from Avon and deliver their orders to them. You pay a discounted price to Avon for the
            products while your customers pay you the full retail price. The difference is your
            profit to keep. Another way to sell products is through your Avon Online Store. Your
            customers place their orders directly to Avon, pays for the product with a credit or
            debit card and Avon sends the product directly to them while you earn the commission.
            The commission is credited to your account within two days.
          </p>

          <h2 class="blog__subheader">How much time do I need to work the business weekly?</h2>
          <p class="blog__paragraph">
            The beauty of selling with Avon is it’s flexibility. The amount of time you put into
            your business is proportional to the amount of money you can earn. You can literally run
            your business as you live your life. You set your own hours at your own pace.
          </p>

          <h2 class="blog__subheader">
            After the Fast Start Program, what are the commission levels?
          </h2>
          <p class="blog__paragraph">
            There are two main product categories of Avon: Beauty (including Beauty & Jewelry and
            Health & Wellness) and Fashion and Home. When you are a brand new representative you
            start off as a Contender. Contenders earn 25% on Beauty and 20% on Fashion and Home.
            Upon selling $5,000 throughout the various campaigns, you achieve Premier status. With
            Premier status, you will earn 30% on Beauty and 20% on Fashion and Home. Once you sell
            $10,000, you become a member of the prestigious President’s Club. At this level you will
            earn 40% on Beauty and 20% on Fashion and Home.

          <p class="blog__paragraph">
            Avon has raised over $800 million towards Breast Cancer research and educational
            programs. And nearly 20 million mammograms and clinical breast exams have also been
            funded. Avon also funded a very successful anti-domestic abuse program for women and
            teens.
          </p>

          <h2 class="blog__subheader">Do I have to place minimum orders monthly or weekly?</h2>
          <p class="blog__paragraph">
            No, there are no minimum orders to place. However, most successful Avon Representatives
            place orders roughly every two weeks. You will also fall in love with the products and
            will want to order products for yourself at a greatly discounted price.
          </p>

          <h2 class="blog__subheader">How much does it cost to become an Avon Representative?</h2>

            earning immediately. Along with your personalized website, you will receive Avon
            products worth $80-$100. There are no additional fees for your ongoing website. By
            selling just $75 worth of products, discounted at 40%, you will earn back your sign up
            fee.
          </p>

          <h2 class="blog__subheader">What training is provided?</h2>

            interactive training module which is updated periodically. You will also have support
            from Avon Care Center specialists.
