          <p class="blog__paragraph">
            With all the thousands of skin care products available, which are the most essential?
            There are three products that are an absolute necessity for every adult. All three of
            these products have been around for decades and are the basis for many different
            formulas. Since they have been around for a couple of decades, there is plenty of
            evidence that these products are effective. Once you have these three products,
            depending on your skin challenges, other products may be added as needed. The three
            products are Vitamin C, Retinol and a good sunscreen.
          </p>

          <div class="blog__img-section-wrapper">
            <h2 class="blog__subheader">Vitamin C</h2>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              Vitamin C in its pure form is Ascorbic Acid. It acts as an antioxidant to reduce
              damage caused by free-radicals. Free radicals are unstable molecules that cause
              inflammation. A simple way to think about free radicals is to recall the retro classic
              video game Pac Man. Free radicals are like Pac Man and the dots that he devours are
              the molecules of the DNA in your skin cells. Skin cells that have been damaged by free
              radicals are prone to premature wrinkles, uneven skin tone, premature cell death, dull
              skin and discolored skin spots. Vitamin C also stimulates the growth of collagen.
              Collagen is a protein that gives your skin strength and elasticity; that ability to
              bounce back. As we age, our cells produce less collagen and inflammation, caused by
              free radicals, can break down the collagen that we have. Collagen rich skin is
              thicker, more elastic, and less likely to wrinkle.

            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              Anew Vitamin C Brightening Serum is your new main squeeze for radiant skin. It
              contains a full 10% of pure vitamin C which is equivalent to thirty oranges. It has
              been reformulated into a light serum that absorbs quickly into the skin. This super
              serum instantly boosts radiance, moisture, and over time, it illuminates, brightens
              and evens out your skin. You can use this formula in the morning and in the evening,
              but it is best to start out slowly. If you use it once a day, use it in the morning
              before you moisturize. After cleansing, smooth the serum gently over your skin in an
              upward and outward motion, avoiding the eye area. Follow with your favorite Avon
              moisturizer. This citrus fragranced formula is hypoallergenic, dermatologist-tested
              and vegan. Anew Vitamin C Brightening Serum is also phthalate-free, sulfate-free,
              petroleum-free, paraben-free. It does not contain oil and it is non-comedogenic which
              means, it will not block pores.

              This warming mask combines Vitamin C flakes and natural seeds to exfoliate and buff
              the skin. It instantly makes your skin feel softer and look brighter. Apply a nickel
              size product to your face as you avoid your eye area. A little goes a long way with
              this product. Once the mask is on the face, wet your fingers with warm water and with
              a feather light touch, gently massage the product into the skin. You will immediately
              feel a warming of the product on your skin. The warming of the mask opens up your
              pores. As you massage the Anew Vitamin C Warming Peel on your face, the Vitamin C
              flakes and the natural seeds, gently exfoliate the top layers of skin. Massage gently
              for up to two minutes. Wash off with lukewarm water over the sink or in the shower.
              You can follow with Anew Vitamin C Brightening Serum.

              This sheer lip treatment is packed with Vitamins C and E. This treatment visibly
              plumps and smooths lips. I use it daily under my regular lipstick and if the weather
              is dry, I reapply it each time I freshen my lipstick. Not only does the lip treatment
              provide your lips with Vitamin C, it also adds an extra layer of moisture to your
              lips. This may be needed when using matte lipsticks. This Vitamin C product is also

            <h2 class="blog__subheader">Retinol</h2>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              Retinol is a form of vitamin A which boosts the amount of collagen and plumps up the
              skin. This reduces the look and depth of fine lines and wrinkles. It is the # 1
              anti-aging ingredient recommended by dermatologists. Retinol also increases the amount
              of blood vessels to the underlying structure of the skin and improves its color. As
              retinol increases skin cell turnover and stimulates collagen synthesis, it also
              improves the texture and tone of the skin. Vitamin derivatives such as retinol, cause
              the top layers of the skin to continuously exfoliate, or shed top dead skin layers.
              This action helps to unclog pores and to keep blackheads and whiteheads away.

            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              This light weight, fast acting serum delivers a powerful wrinkle-fighting action. As a
              retinol treatment product, it delivers a wrinkle fighting action via an exclusive
              Amino Acid complex. This complex works twice as fast and is more powerful at fighting
              wrinkles than a leading dermatologist inspired treatment. Anew Clinical Line Eraser
              with Retinol is suitable for all skin types (normal, oily, dry, combination) and
              sensitive skin. The serum is non-comedogenic and non- acnegenic. Line Eraser has been
              clinically shown to reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles in just days and
              provides an overall youthful appearance. In the morning and evening, apply to cleansed
              face and neck. The serum glides on effortlessly and absorbs quickly. Follow this
              product with a moisturizer. If you experience sun sensitivity, it is best to use this
              product in the evening after you cleanse your face. Retinol can make your skin
              increase its sensitivity to the sum. Always use a broad-spectrum sunscreen to prevent
              sun burn.

            </h2>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              This targeted treatment is designed to smooth deeper lines around the mouth and
              forehead. Vitamins C and E and Retinol combine in a formula that contains a
              dual-delivery system for time released line reducing results. Vitamin E is also a
              super antioxidant. It acts to reduce the appearance of fine lines, age spots, and
              wrinkles, and it protects against the damage caused by sun exposure. In a short amount
              of time, younger, softer skin is revealed. This action produces a more refined,
              flawless finish. With continued use, Anew Clinical Line Eraser improves the overall
              health of skin. Apply a pea sized amount of the Retinol Targeted Treatment five
              minutes after you have cleansed your face. Because the concentration of Retinol is
              high, only apply this in the evening. Avoid putting the Targeted Treatment around the
              eye or eyelid.

              The greatest enemies of skin is time and sun. And while we cannot do much about time,
              we can ensure the utmost protection of our skin by using an appropriate sunscreen. Not
              only does using a sunscreen prevent against premature aging, it also protects against
              skin cancer. Sunlight contains both UVA and UVB rays. UVA rays are responsible for
              aging. These rays can cause leathery skin, sun spots and wrinkles. UVB rays are most
              responsible for skin cancer. These rays are most prevalent during the midday. Both
              types of rays are damaging, and can be protected against by using a broad-spectrum
              sunscreen. Anew Hydra Fusion SPF 50 is a broad-spectrum sunscreen and it contains
              antioxidants to protect against free radical damage. This formula is also lightly
              moisturizing and phthalate, sulfate, and petroleum free. After moisturizing smooth
              over the entire face and neck before applying makeup.

              Using Retinol and Vitamin C together can bring about superior results. Because both

              morning and Retinol in the evening.
