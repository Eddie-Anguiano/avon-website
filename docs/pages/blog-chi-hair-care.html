          <p class="blog__paragraph">
            Give your locks the love they deserve! Great hair every day! I can tell you that I saw a
            difference in my hair the first time I used the products. The fragrance is amazing and
            the texture of the products is silky. I have now been using the CHI Hair Care Products
            for Avon, and my hair hasn’t been this silky and shiny in years! The system is a
            four-product system that gives you salon grade quality made with natural ingredients.
            New Avon has partnered with Farouk Systems Inc. To formulate a hair care system
            exclusively for Avon. This four-part system is salon quality and made with organic Aloe
            Vera. Farouk Systems is the manufacturer of high-quality professional hair care products
            such as CHI and BioSilk. Farouk Systems strives to provide the professional beauty
            industry based upon technology that exemplifies their mission of, “Education,
            Environment and Ethics.” Avon Chi Essentials consists of are 90% natural and sulfate and
            PABA free. They contain ingredients like Pomegranate, Hibiscus and Organic Aloe Vera.
            All have a low PH and they provide antioxidants and balanced care for the hair and
            scalp. The key ingredients, provide moisture and strength to all hair types.

          <div class="blog__img-section-wrapper">
            <h2 class="blog__subheader">Why is CHI sulfate and PABA free?</h2>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              Sulfates are used to maintain the lather in the shampoo. They grab ahold of the dirt,
              grime and oils. Harsh sulfates can also strip your hair of necessary natural oils
              which can dry your hair out and fade hair color. Sulfates can cause irritation of the
              scalp and the eyes as they are sulfur-containing salts. However, less irritating
              components can clean the hair without over stripping it or drying it out. That is why
              the Avon formulations do not use sulfates. PABA, or para-aminobenzoic acid can also be
              another ingredient that can irritate skin and cause allergic reactions. After all,
              your hair shaft is connected to your scalp and oil glands. It can also cause
              sun-sensitivity of the scalp. Avon’s CHI formulations contain no PABA.

              What are the benefits of Hibiscus, Organic Aloe Vera, and Pomegranate?
            </h2>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              Aloe Vera is a natural humectant, which means that it reduces the loss of moisture.
              Dry hair is prone to breakage and split ends. Because the Aloe acts as a humectant, it
              provides strength to the hair shaft and prevents it from splitting. Pomegranate is
              antioxidant rich. Antioxidants can protect hair follicles from free radicals which can
              damage the follicle. Healthy follicles regulate hair growth. Pomegranate also helps to
              provide a proper PH for the hair. A proper PH value prevents hair from becoming dry,
              brittle or frizzy. Hibiscus is rich in amino acids and vitamins. Since hair is made of
              proteins and amino acids make up proteins, amino acids are beneficial. They can make
              the hair stronger and increase its elasticity. Hibiscus also keeps your natural hair
              color vibrant. The vitamins that Hibiscus provides such as C and riboflavin, improves
              blood circulation and stimulates healthy hair growth.

            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              The shampoo is a heavenly fragrance with a colorless light texture. It lathers up
              nicely and washes out completely but leaves the nice scent behind. I have long,
              straight, thin hair so I use about a quarter-size of product. I only lather once as
              that seems sufficient to clean my hair. Because I have straight hair, it tends to be
              oily so I wash my hair every other day. Curlier hair tends to be drier and more
              fragile because it is harder for natural oils to move down the entire hair shaft. This
              shampoo is gentle so it can be used daily and it is also gentle enough for colored or
              permed hair. I have very hard water and it tends to dry out my scalp. I have noticed
              that the dryness has improved. The bottle contains 12 fl. Oz. and the bottle is
              attractive for the bathroom.

            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              The conditioner is milky white with a thicker consistency with the same lovely smell.
              I use a quarter size amount and I apply the conditioner about four inches from my
              crown. Because my hair is thin and oily, I don’t use too much conditioner near my
              roots so that I can maintain volume. For thin to medium hair, leave the product on 6
              to 8 minutes. For course, or brittle hair, leave the conditioner on for 10 minutes.
              When washing or conditioning hair, it is best not to use water that is too hot as it
              is not good for your hair or the skin on your face. The Aloe rich formula locks in
              moisture and helps to smooth split ends and frizz.

              This is my favorite part of my hair care routine! This Serum is so light and takes
              such a small amount to impart shine, shine, shine! Because my hair is long, the ends
              were very dry and not attractive. I pour a dime size of serum into my hands and rub my
              hands together. I then comb my fingers through my hair starting with the ends. I
              couldn’t believe the difference the first time I used this product. My split ends
              disappeared, my hair was so soft and healthy and shiny. The serum contains rosemary to
              add volume and the vitamin A helps to seal split ends. I rub the rest into my hands as
              it also moisturizes the skin and leaves that wonderful smell.

            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              The thermal spray is Infused with essential nutrients, antioxidants and vitamins to
              help protect hair from damaging heat from blow drying, hot irons and rollers. Silk
              molecules help lock in moisture and reduce frizz. I have also used this as a very
              light holding spray. Spritz 2 to 3 times on each side of the head while holding the
              spray about 5 inches from the scalp. You can use this spray prior to blow drying and
              then again if you are going to use a hot iron.
