            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              Green Goddess is Avon’s introduction into the CBD skincare market. This unique product
              is a CBD infused facial oil. It acts as a gentle moisturizer and soothes the skin upon
              application. It is perfect for anyone with troubled, dry, sensitive or fatigued skin.
              This is also for anyone who wants luxuriously moisturized radiant skin. In addition to
              broad spectrum CBD, this dry oil contains hemp seed oil, jojoba oil, squalane oil,
              sesame seed oil and Azulane oil. It is a simple product with just eight ingredients,
              but it is an extremely effective anti-inflammatory and it greatly soothes away any
              redness of the skin. Green Goddess is fragrance free and it rapidly absorbs into the
              skin. This facial oil is 99% pure. There is just a touch of a safe synthetic, caprylyl
              glycol, which is used as a preservative to prevent bacteria from forming. The hemp is
              sourced from here in the United States and the shelf life of Green Goddess is three
              years. Each bottle contains 100 mg of CBD, cleanly formulated. Green Goddess is
              allergy tested and 100% vegan.

          <div class="blog__img-section-wrapper">
            <h2 class="blog__subheader">What is CBD or Cannabidiol?</h2>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              Cannabidiol gives the oil an anti-inflammatory property. It also decreases excess
              facial oil, it visibly diminishes wrinkles, skin dullness and is an excellent
              antioxidant. CBD containing creams also correct ruddy skin tones and any type of
              redness due to irritation due to its soothing properties. In this instance,
              cannabidiol is extracted as a powder from the leaves and flowers and mixed with oils.
              Because the CBD is extracted from Hemp, the oil does not contain THC, the psychoactive
              ingredient that gets you high in marijuana. The CBD used in Green Goddess is a
              broad-spectrum CBD, which means that THC is not detectable.
            </p>

          <div class="blog__img-section-wrapper">
            <h2 class="blog__subheader">What is dry oil?</h2>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              A dry oil is a lightweight, non-greasy, quickly absorbing oil for the skin. One to two
              drops of Green Goddess absorbs into the skin in about 10 seconds. It does not leave an
              oily residue because it does not sit on the top layers of skin cells.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="blog__img-section-wrapper">
            <h2 class="blog__subheader">What are the other ingredients in Green Goddess?</h2>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              Green Goddess also contains hemp seed oil, turmeric, jojoba seed oil, squalane oil and
              azulane oil. Before I list the properties of the additional ingredients, I will define
              a couple of terms. A humectant works like a magnet to pull water out of the air and
              bonds with it. This increases the moisture in the skin. Emollients are used to soften
              and smooth the scales of the skin. This reduces rough, flaky skin.

              <p class="blog__list-content">
                <span class="font--bold">Azulane</span> is from the chamomile flower. It is an
                anti-inflammatory, an antioxidant, and an antiseptic. Blemishes and acne can be
                reduced and it prevents sun damage and repairs damaged cells. Azulane also soothes
                irritated skin.

              <p class="blog__list-content">
                <span class="font--bold">Jojoba</span> seed oil is a humectant and it seals in
                moisture with a protective layer. It’s makeup is similar to sebum, the skin’s
                natural oil. So, it has the ability to balance oily skin and acts to kill bacteria
                on the skin and is non comedogenic, (it doesn’t clog pores.)

                <span class="font--bold">Squalane</span> oil, from sugarcane, acts as an emollient
                to boost hydration to make skin look healthy and vibrant. It can squeeze into the
                spaces between the skin cells and make the skin feel smoother. Squalane is an
                antioxidant and it boosts the formation of collagen.

            <h2 class="blog__subheader">How do I use Green Goddess in my skincare regimen?</h2>
            <p class="blog__paragraph">
              A good skin regimen can be made up of three to four steps. You can categorize the
              steps into prep (cleanse,) treat, moisturize and if it is a morning regimen, you
              should include a product with an SPF. Green Goddess is a facial oil which is a
              moisturizer. It should follow any treatment products that you use. It is a light
              moisturizer so it may be used with an additional moisturizer if you have really dry
              skin. Apply it after your regular moisturizer. Four to six drops should be sufficient
              for your face. You can use Green Goddess in the morning and in the evening.
