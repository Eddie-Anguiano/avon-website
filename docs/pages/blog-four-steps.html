          <h2 class="blog__subheader--brown"></h2>
          <p class="blog__paragraph--indent">
            I have been involved with Avon in one capacity or another, for the last 33 years. I have
            sold at Rose Circle level, was one of the first Leadership Representatives and was an
            Avon District Manager for thirteen years. There are four essential steps, I have found,
            to grow an Avon business. You must first create a list of potential customers, expand
            your product knowledge, plan your planning sessions, and most importantly, step out of
            your box!
          </p>

          <div class="blog__img-wrapper--small">
            <img
              src="../images/blog-four-steps/edit.svg"
              alt="pen and pad image"
              class="blog__img-wrapper--small"
            />
          </div>
          <h2 class="blog__subheader--brown">Create A Customer List</h2>
          <p class="blog__paragraph--indent">
            Creating a customer list will always be an ongoing process. But it is an exciting first
            step! It is important to spend enough time on this as this will be the foundation of
            your business.
          </p>
          <p class="blog__indent-item">
            <span class="font--bold">Warm List</span>- You should sit down with paper or a tablet
            and your mobile phone. As you are going through your contacts, don’t prejudge who might
            or might not be interested. Figure out how it is best to share your product with each
            person. Will you first send a link to your website, or have a Grand Opening on Social
            Media or text a link to a digital brochure or will you provide your contact with a full
            paper brochure in person or by mail? This will be your warm list of people who you
            already have relationships with.
          </p>
          <p class="blog__indent-item">
            <span class="font--bold">Time to expand</span>- Once you are done with your warm list,
            you will want to try to expand your potential customer base. One way to do that is to
            give close family members and friends a copy of an Avon Brochure. Ask them if they would
            take the brochure to work or show the book to their family and friends for you. I did
            this when I first started selling Avon as I had babies at home. Because of the help from
            family members, I could easily come up with ten to fifteen additional orders per
            campaign.
          </p>
          <p class="blog__indent-item--margin-bottom">
            <span class="font--bold">Call Back Notes</span>- You can order a business aide called,
            Call Back Notes, product number 310-639. They are twenty-five cents for a pad of 50. You
            can attach these notes to any AVON brochures that you hand out. There is room for
            contact information as well as a place for product name, quantity, product number and
            price. If you would like to send out a brochure by mail, there is a service called,
            Campaign Mailer. You can open up an account. They will do all the work for you and send
            brochures out via USPS.

            Expand Your Product Knowledge - Enthusiasm Sells Product!
          </h2>
          <p class="blog__paragraph--indent">
            If you have ever seen a really outstanding movie, what is the first thing you do? You
            tell anyone who will listen that they have to see that movie! You might post a pic with
            your praise on FaceBook, Instagram or send out a tweet about it. You might text family
            and friends. Well, that is exactly the way you sell products. If you have been selling
            for a while or if you are new to sales, enthusiasm sells! You will find that the
            products you use, will be the products that you sell. Your customers will expect you to
            be an expert on the products that you sell.<br /><br />Use your Demo opportunity to
            order new products ahead of their debut. You will have the opportunity to learn about
            these products before they are presented as a demo by watching the training team on Avon
            U, FaceBook and weekly webinars. Every Monday, a list of upcoming training sessions are
            listed under Beauty Buzz on your AVON now website. Just click on View All. The FaceBook
            training is available under videos. For the webinars, it is wise to register for them.
            Click on the particular webinar you are interested in and register for the event. You
            will receive confirmation and reminders by email. If you miss the webinar, you will
            receive a playback link to watch the webinar on your own time. On FaceBook, click on the
            interested icon so that you will receive reminders as well. Many webinars are archived
            under Avon U. If you cannot attend any of these trainings live, they are available as a
            replay.

          <p class="blog__indent-item">
            <span class="font--bold">Avon U Training</span>- Avon U is the training section found on
            the Avon Now website. If you are using the mobile version, click on the three vertical
            bars on the top left of the page. A list will come up that includes Avon U. For the
            desktop version, you will find Avon U Training on the top black bar on the top left of
            the page. Here you will find business and product training modules and one-page product
            fact sheets that you can print out.
          </p>
          <p class="blog__indent-item">
            <span class="font--bold">FaceBook – Avon USA Representatives</span>- Although Avon
            recommends promoting your business through social media such as FaceBook, Instagram, and
            Pinterest, FaceBook, under the page, Avon USA Representatives is where Avon provides
            Facebook Live training sessions and videos. Subjects such as skincare, jewelry, makeup
            tutorials and fragrance training are offered on a weekly basis.
          </p>
          <p class="blog__indent-item--margin-bottom">
            <span class="font--bold">GoTo Webinars</span>- Interactive webinars are regularly
            scheduled to provide additional product information. These are usually used to introduce
            new products. They normally run from 30 minutes to one hour. The platform used is Goto
            Webinars. The program can be downloaded to your phone or to a desktop.

          <h2 class="blog__subheader--brown">Plan Your Planning</h2>
          <p class="blog__paragraph--indent">
            When I was an AVON District Manager, I was required to have a full planning day every
            campaign. I suggest you plan a time when you can calendar in training, order submission,
            deliveries of brochures and or products.
          </p>

          <p class="blog__indent-item">
            <span class="font--bold">Set up a calendar system</span>- I have always liked using a
            paper calendar and pencil for short and long term goals but I also like using an
            electronic calendar on my phone as well. When you sign up for a training webinar,
            AvonNow will automatically add it to your calendar. My phone calendar is also used as an
            alarm to remind me of upcoming events. If you are a Leadership Representative, you will
            also need time to go over your team’s progress.
          </p>

          <p class="blog__indent-item--margin-bottom">
            <span class="font--bold">Track your incentives</span>- Incentives are always being
            offered by New Avon. So, if you are tracking a trip to the Caribbean or a cash bonus or
            one of the Avon Rewards, you will need to make sure you are on point. I find that Monday
            is a good day to plan because the training schedule comes out on the Beauty Buzz every
            Monday.

          <p class="blog__paragraph--indent">
            One of the most gratifying experiences of being a Leader and a District Manager is
            watching people grow in confidence and trying new things to grow their business. As you
            gain confidence in your product knowledge and your sales skills, you will be ready to
            grow your business beyond your family and friends, or your warm list. Vendor shows are a
            way to gain new customers and team members. Local community fairs, holiday boutiques,
            school events, and chamber of commerce groups regularly offer opportunities to set up
            tables to sell products and to interact with potential customers. You would want to set
            up an attractively displayed table with Avon Brochures, Avon products, samples and
            recruiting materials. You can offer a sample basket of products to raffle so that you
            can collect names, phone numbers and emails to follow up.<br /><br />
            Avon Parties can be conducted live or even via Facebook Live Stream. You can have
            different themes for your parties such as skincare, jewelry, holiday items or spa
            products. Simple games can be played and you will want to demonstrate product use. If
            you have a host, you can reward him/her with a gift or a discount on their personal
            order. You can also join numerous Facebook groups where other representatives share
            innovative ideas on group parties and display ideas.
          </p>

          <p class="blog__indent-item">
            <span class="font--bold">Social Media</span>- Many representatives create YouTube
            videos, FaceBook Live events, and Instagram posts/stories to expand their Social Media
            presence. Avon provides outstanding training in Social Media by a professional Social
            Media trainer. The training is called Avon Social Selling. You will be taught branding
            skills, Social Media do’s and don’ts and taught how to use Avon widgets to expand your
            sales. Avon U is also available to every Representative and now offers 43 courses. The
            important thing is to make this business your own. The amount of flexibility that Avon
            provides is enormous. Don’t forget to have fun with it!
